# Sanskrit Search Engine

A command-line Sanskrit search tool that indexes Devanagari text from PDF documents using a Trie data structure. It supports exact word search and prefix-based autocomplete functionality. Outputs are optionally saved to JSON for later use.

---

## Features

- Extracts text from PDFs using `pdfplumber` or OCR fallback via `pytesseract`
- Normalizes and tokenizes Sanskrit (Devanagari) words
- Indexes words into a persistent Trie structure with document references
- Supports:
  - **Exact word search** (with document and position metadata)
  - **Autocomplete suggestions** for Devanagari prefixes
- Results are printed to terminal and optionally written to file

---

## Architecture

- **Trie Node Structure**: Stores word segments, flags for complete words, and document references
- **Text Extraction**:
  - First attempts to extract text using `pdfplumber`
  - Falls back to OCR using `pytesseract` if no text is found
- **Preprocessing**: Unicode normalization and Devanagari-only filtering
- **Persistent Indexing**: Trie can be saved and reused, avoiding reprocessing PDFs
- **Interactive CLI**: Menu-driven system with numeric input mapped to actions
